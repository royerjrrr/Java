Interstellar one of my favorite movies, it tells the story of Joseph Cooper a farmer who worked at NASA, was one of those chosen with three other astronauts, to go on a journey of almost no return in order to save humanity from environmental degradation that afflicts the earth, they had to sacrifice themselves to go another galaxy where there are three planets where the inhabitants of the earth can live, Cooper leaves behind his daughter Murhp, who plays an important role in the film decrypts the quantum data sent by his father.
Because I recommend it is an epic and visually stunning science fiction film with a strong emotional component.
